What does a Developer Product Marketing Manager actually do? Why is your title on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.. different? Is your work really distributing stickers and searching for gifs to reply on social media? Wait.. did your official title say.. Marketing??

All valid questions. Luckily my teammate Jussi wrote a blog about what we actually do, how we work and who the team is. What sums it all up for me:
_At first, it might seem we’re all over the place, but at the end of the day it’s quite clear – **we are passionate about Azure and developers**. Thus, we drive the efforts to support and understand Azure communities and developers. Our view on developers is broad – everyone who gets paid to “engineer stuff”, to put it bluntly._ [Read Jussis' blogpost here](https://jussiroine.com/2020/04/im-an-azure-developer-product-marketing-managers-at-microsoft-what-do-i-do/)
