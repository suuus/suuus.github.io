<h3>Bio</h3>
Suzanne works for Microsoft The Netherlands in developer engegament. You might have guessed that she must love developers, coding, and technology! <br />
Currently she works on some virtual community events (like https://azureday.community), engaging content and of course getting developers hands-on with tech.<br />
Being able to work on topics she's passionate about keep her going every day. <br />
In her spare time her family shares the first place with Animal Crossing. It’s a rainbow family 🏳‍🌈 made up of her soonish-wife-to-be, a daughter<br />
of 13 and an 8-year-old son. Also she teaches kids about Diversity and she loves mixing some records for fun. And she is a big reader, mostly fictional<br />
work about dystopian futures 🤷🏻‍♀‍.
